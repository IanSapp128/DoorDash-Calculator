# DoorDash-Calculator
As the resident holder of DashPass and host of multiple people at my house each week, I was getting tired of having to calculate everybody's totals by hand.
I built this script so that I can just type in everybody's items and divy up all the fees based on number of participants. It's very basic, I typed this up really quick
one night when I had to send out payment requests.

## How it works
Enter the number of participants and it will ask you for their names. **If you just press enter without entering anything it will skip that person.** The reason for this is
so that you can exclude yourself but the number of participants is still used for the calculations at the end. Once you enter a name, you put in the cost of their items.
Again, **if you enter nothing and keep it blank it will assume you want to move on to the next person.** There's no bug checking or anything complex here. I really just
use this to make my own life easier and am posting it here for archival reasons.
